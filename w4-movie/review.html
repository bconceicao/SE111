                In one of the few Batman movies worth watching, <i>The Dark Knight</i> faces off against the ultimate villain in the form of The Joker. While trying to put a stop to organized crime families in Gotham, Batman forces the heads of these families into a difficult position. Out of desperation, they turn to the Joker. As a man with absolutely no fear and nothing to lose, the Joker lives off chaos. He is determined to tear down the entire city of Gotham, while simply asking the Batman to reveal his true identity.

                What truly sets this movie apart is the cast. Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine all put in some of the best performances you will ever see in an action movie. The greatest villain ever played on the big screen, Heath played the Joker so well that I truly believe it is a character that should have never been played again.
